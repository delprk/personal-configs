# purpose
this is just an area for me to keep my important config files safe in the cloud but also as an excuse to learn git

# xmonad
xmonad.hs -- main script/config file for xmonad -- put in ~/.xmonad/xmonad.hs

# startup
lightdm.conf -- main config file for lightdm -- put in /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf

xprofile -- startup file -- put in ~/.xprofile

# kitty
kitty.conf -- main config file for kitty -- put in ~/.config/kitty/kitty.conf

theme.conf -- theme config file for kitty -- put in ~/.config/kitty/theme.conf
